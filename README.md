"single factory :factory: you can not build using prototype"

1. Singleton Pattern
2. Factory Pattern
3. Abstract Factory Pattern
4. Builder Pattern
5. Prototype Pattern


## Prototype Pattern

* In the prototype pattern, a new object is created by cloning an existing object.
* In JavaSW, the clone() method is an implementation of this design pattern.
* The prototype pattern can be a useful way of creating copies of objects.
* if an original object is created with a resource such as a data stream that may not be available at the time that a clone of the object is needed.
* if the original object creation involves a significant time commitment, such as reading data from a databaseW or over a network.
* you can utilize the clone() method and the Cloneable interface. By default, clone() performs a shallow copy.

> Create an interface of type Prototype which return Prototype and implement with various class like Person & Dog .
> in doClone method return new Object of same type

```java
public interface Prototype {

	public Prototype doClone();

}
```

```java
public class Person implements Prototype {

	String name;

	public Person(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	@Override
	public Prototype doClone() {
		return new Person(name);
	}

	public String toString() {
		return "This person is named " + name;
	}
}
```

```java
public class Dog implements Prototype {

	String sound;

	public Dog(String sound) {
		this.sound = sound;
	}

	@Override
	public Prototype doClone() {
		return new Dog(sound);
	}

	public String toString() {
		return "This dog says " + sound;
	}
}
```
